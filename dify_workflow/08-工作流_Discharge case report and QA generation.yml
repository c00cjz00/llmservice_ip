            Based on the patient‚Äôs case report provided, please

            generate a synthetic discharge summary in the style

            of an Electronic Health Record (EHR).

            Please follow these requirements:

            1. Generate only the discharge summary. Do not

            generate any other phrases such as notification.

            2. If there are any standard clinical terms used in

            the case report, they should be replaced with their

            commonly used non-standardized equivalents in the

            discharge summary. For example, "hypercholesterolemia" can be rewritten
            as "high cholesterol".

            3. The discharge summary includes abbreviations

            that are not defined in the context.

            4. The discharge summary may contain minor grammatical errors.

            5. Ensure that the discharge summary does not contain any clinical information
            or details (such as medication names, dosages, treatment plans, diagnoses,

            procedures, test results, etc.) that are not explicitly

            mentioned or defined within the given case report.

            6. While preserving the structure of the EHR and

            maintaining medical consistency, generate a detailed

            and comprehensive discharge summary.

            7. The discharge summary is a comprehensive document that can be organized
            using several distinct

            headings.

            8. For patients who have not yet been discharged, create a section in
            the discharge summary summarizing

            their medical progression'

            We also offer five example questions related to the task for your reference.
            Although you can refer to these samples, try to create a distinct query.
            The crucial aspect of your question is that it should be answerable using
            only the information available in the discharge summary. Also, try to
            keep your question as brief and straightforward as possible.

            [Example Questions Begin]

            "Can you identify and categorize all the medical conditions"

            "Could you extract all medications prescribed and

            their corresponding dosages?"

            "What were the diagnostic tests and their results?"

            "Identify all the medical procedures"

            "Can you recognize and list any lifestyle factors such

            as smoking, alcohol consumption, or exercise habits"

            Above, we provide you with a discharge summary

            and the instruction that the healthcare professional

            gave about the discharge summary. You are also

            provided with 3 corresponding responses from 3 different

            clinical models. Your task is to read the discharge

            summary and the instruction carefully, then find the

            answer to the instruction. Then, compare your answer with each model‚Äôs
            response and evaluate the

            response based on the following criteria.

            Criteria :

            1. Unacceptable (1 point): The model‚Äôs response

            includes any incorrect or irrelevant content. If the

            instruction was unanswerable, the model did not acknowledge this and outputs
            the wrong answer.

            2. Poor (2 points): The model‚Äôs response does not

            contain any incorrect or irrelevant content but omits

            significant or crucial content that the instruction is

            required for.

            3. Satisfactory (3 points): The model‚Äôs response

            does not contain any incorrect or irrelevant contents

            but omits minor or insignificant contents that the

            instruction is required for.

            4. Excellent (4 points): The model‚Äôs response contains all the necessary
            information that the instruction

            is requiring for. If the instruction was unanswerable,

            the model correctly acknowledged this and says that

            it was unanswerable.

            When evaluating each score based on the above criteria, ensure that each
            judgment is not affected by the

            other model‚Äôs response.

            The first line must contain only {Number of Samples} values, which indicate
            the score for each model,

            respectively. The {Number of Samples} scores are

            separated by a space. Output scores without explanation.'

          symptoms of fever, dry cough, and dyspnea. We encountered several difficulties
          during physical therapy on the acute ward. First, any change of position
          or deep breathing triggered coughing attacks that induced oxygen desaturation
          and dyspnea. To avoid rapid deterioration and respiratory failure, we instructed
          and performed position changes very slowly and step-by-step. In this way,
          a position change to the 135¬∞ prone position () took around 30 minutes.
          This approach was well tolerated and increased oxygen saturation, for example,
          on day 5 with 6 L/min of oxygen from 93% to 97%. Second, we had to adapt
          the breathing exercises to avoid prolonged coughing and oxygen desaturation.
          Accordingly, we instructed the patient to stop every deep breath before
          the need to cough and to hold inspiration for better air distribution. In
          this manner, the patient performed the breathing exercises well and managed
          to increase his oxygen saturation. Third, the patient had difficulty maintaining
          sufficient oxygen saturation during physical activity. However, with close
          monitoring and frequent breaks, he managed to perform strength and walking
          exercises at a low level without any significant deoxygenation. Exercise
          progression was low on days 1 to 5, but then increased daily until hospital
          discharge to a rehabilitation clinic on day 10.","type":"text","version":1}],"direction":"ltr","format":"left","indent":0,"type":"paragraph","version":1,"textFormat":0}],"direction":"ltr","format":"","indent":0,"type":"root","version":1}}'
